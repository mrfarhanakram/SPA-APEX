#### Introduction to SPA - Single Page Application
A **single-page application (SPA)** is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. These days SPAs are in high demand due to **Smoother user experience** as compared to traditional method. SPAs can provide a more seamless and engaging user experience by allowing users to interact with the application without having to wait for pages to load.
